## Usage

Here is snapshot of blgr.py script:

    usage: blgr.py [-h] -c CONFIG_PATH {serve,create,generate} ...

    blgr cli

    positional arguments:
      {serve,create,generate}
                            command

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -c CONFIG_PATH, --config_path CONFIG_PATH
                            path to config file

As for now it is not set to be used as cli application, but just python script.
